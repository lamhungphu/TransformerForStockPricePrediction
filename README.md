# Stock Price Prediction with Transformer Model

This repository explores the use of a Transformer model for stock price prediction. Transformers have shown promising results in various sequence prediction tasks, making them well-suited for analyzing financial time series data.

This implementation leverages the Transformer architecture's ability to capture long-range dependencies within stock price data.

The code provides a framework for training and evaluating a Transformer-based model for stock price forecasting.

**Here are steps to run the code:**
1. Open Google Colab
2. Download Transfromer(10_Companies).ipynb and data of 10 stocks
3. Open the file in Colab
4. Upload 10 stocks files into Colab
5. Run the code

**Disclaimer:**

- This is a for-educational-purposes implementation. Stock price prediction is inherently uncertain, and this model should not be used for real-world financial decisions.

**Further Exploration:**

- Experiment with different Transformer hyperparameters (e.g., number of layers, attention heads).
- Explore incorporating additional features like technical indicators or market sentiment data.
- Compare the performance of the Transformer model with other architectures like CNN-LSTMs.
- Implement a backtesting framework to evaluate the model's performance on historical data.
